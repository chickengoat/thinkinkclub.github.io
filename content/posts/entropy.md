Context : entropy is a little poem about order vs disorder and the effort it takes to work

dont fret young man\
i bet you can\
even without a plan\
defeat the ceiling fan

power we must save\
strange weather youll brave\
little watt by watt\
energy budget ration rat

hero enters no fret\
its a winning bet\
reduce reuse recycle select\
windmills will joules collect
