MASKED WORLD

The world masks itself with dark negativity,\
Hiding its light in shadows of uncertainty.\
A place where hope is drowned by despair,\
Yet whispers of change linger in the air.




Synopsis\

This stanza portrays a world cloaked in deep negativity, where any positive light or potential is hidden behind shadows of uncertainty and doubt.\
In this place, hope struggles to survive, constantly overwhelmed and "drowned" by the weight of despair.\
However, despite the dominance of negativity, there remains a faint sense—a "whisper"—that change is still possible, lingering subtly in the background, suggesting that even in darkness, the potential for transformation is never fully lost.
