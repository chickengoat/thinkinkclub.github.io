Context : windmill is a poem with admiration for windmills.

i stand tall alone\
like a tree clone\
i create ambient order\
from apparent environmental disorder

must save our kind\
together meditate hive mind\
environment saving solution find\
pick joules slow grind

have many a foe\
pollution, corruption, war woe\
noble destiny it knows\
as the wind blows
