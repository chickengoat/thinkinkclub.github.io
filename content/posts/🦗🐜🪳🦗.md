cricket grasshopper ant and roach\
from the jungle to suburbia approach\
who will be the most successful\
to colonize our quarters unremorseful

the ant seems adept at such\
roach ain't bothered that much\
cricket's busy with leg exercise\
grasshopper's downing spirit not wise

suburbia turns into urban jungle\
all varied lifeforms do mingle\
flora fauna we must restore\
just as it was in in old folklore
